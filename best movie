I havent seen any movies lately so ill be talking about a video game. Atomicrops is an amasing game i pkayed during the summer. Its a rogue lite farming simulator. the slogan of the game is farm, marry, kill. More or less you go through post apocoliptic seasons growing crops while protecting them from enemies. i highly recomend it.
